Task management for software development sprints.

## Getting Started

### Install Tools and Dependencies

  1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)
  1. ``npm install -g gulp``
  1. ``npm install``

### Building the Application

Run ``gulp`` from the project root. The application will be compiled
into the ``dist`` directory.

### Developing with LiveReload

Run ``gulp live`` from the project root, then browse to
http://localhost:4000. Changes to the html, js, and jsx files will be
detected, triggering the source bundle to compiled, triggering a
notification to the livereload server, triggering the browser to
refresh.
